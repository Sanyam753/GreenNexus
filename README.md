# 🌿 Green Score Fintech Project 🌿

Welcome to the Green Score Fintech Project! This project aims to integrate a sustainability score into banking systems, helping users to monitor and improve their environmental impact through their financial activities.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Green Score Fintech Project involves developing a machine learning model that predicts a user's green score based on various financial features. This score can help users understand their environmental footprint and make more sustainable financial decisions.

## 🌟 Features

- **Green Score Prediction**: Predict a user's green score based on financial data.
- **Sustainability Insights**: Provide actionable insights to help users make more sustainable financial decisions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize data and model predictions using interactive plots.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extendable to include more features and data points.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for making predictions.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanyam753/greenscore-fintech.git
cd greenscore-fintech
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore the data using the Jupyter notebook provided in the `notebooks/` directory. This notebook includes visualizations and insights about the dataset.

## 🧠 Training the Model

Train the machine learning model using the data provided. The model is designed to predict the green score based on various financial features. Ensure your data is preprocessed correctly before training.

## 🔮 Making Predictions

Use the `predict.py` script to make predictions with the trained model. The script reads new data, applies the saved scaler, and outputs the predicted green scores.

### Usage

1. Place your new data file (`new_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python scripts/predict.py
```

## ⚙️ Customization

Modify the `expected_features` list in the `predict.py` script to match the features used during training. Ensure the DataFrame contains all necessary columns in the correct order.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Banking APIs**: Direct integration with banking APIs to fetch real-time transaction data.
- **User Dashboard**: Development of a user-friendly dashboard to track green scores over time.
- **Mobile App**: Launch a mobile application for on-the-go access to green scores and insights.
- **Community Features**: Allow users to share their green scores and sustainability efforts with a community.
